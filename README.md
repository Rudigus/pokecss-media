# pokecss-media

Compilation of images of all 6th+ Geneneration Pokémon 3D sprites, icons and items.

The aim of this project is to compile a set of graphics from the main series games,
containing:
* All Pokémon sprites based on 3D **models**,
* All Pokémon menu **icons**
* All **items**
* Important metagame **symbols** and misc.

This project also contains a set of **glyphs** for generating a Pokémon icon font, for
 the [PokeCSS](https://github.com/metaunicorn/pokecss) project.

The naming if the sprites is consistent with the Pokémon codenames of the
 [PokeData](https://github.com/metaunicorn/pokedata) project database, so they are
 easily referentiable.


**IMPORTANT**:

1. All sprites prior to Gen 6 that are not based on 3D models,
official artworks, or sprites from spin-off games won't be included in this project.
Please don't ask to add them.
2. Do not hotlink the images from your website to this Github repository, otherwise
the possible high bandwidth can cause the elimination of this repository.
3. When using the sprites in your website, you may want to consider using the non-animated
ones, because their size are considerably small: all of them are just 6MB compared to the 200MB
of the animated ones.


## TO-DO

### Missing 3D sprites

- Cosplay Pikachu forms (all)
- Furfrou haircut forms (all)
