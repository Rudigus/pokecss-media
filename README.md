**NOTE:** This is a fork of a now removed respository.

Compilation of images of all 6th+ Geneneration Pokémon 3D sprites, icons and items.

The aim of this project is to compile a set of graphics from the main series games,
containing:
* All Pokémon sprites based on 3D **models**,
* All Pokémon menu **icons**
* All **items**
* Important metagame **symbols** and misc.

This project also contains a set of **glyphs** for generating a Pokémon icon font, for
 the [PokeCSS](https://github.com/metaunicorn/pokecss) project.

The naming if the sprites is consistent with the Pokémon codenames of the
 [PokeData](https://github.com/metaunicorn/pokedata) project database, so they are
 easily referentiable.

**Do not hotlink the images from your website to this Github repository, otherwise
the possible high bandwidth can cause the elimination of this repository.**

## TO-DO

### Missing 3D sprites

- Cosplay Pikachu forms (all)
- Furfrou haircut forms (all)
- Shiny Unown forms (front and back)
- Vivillon Pokeball and Fancy forms (back and back shiny)
